# Scheduler App

This project contains a full-stack application with separate frontend and backend components designed for scheduling events. The frontend is built using Angular, while the backend is created using Node.js and Express.

## Features

- **Frontend (Angular)**: Responsive UI for scheduling events.
- **Backend (Node.js, Express)**: RESTful API for managing events, including CRUD operations.
- **Database**: (Specify your database, e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) for storing event data.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14+ recommended)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/scheduler-app.git
cd scheduler-app

### 2. Install Dependencies
Frontend
Navigate to the scheduler-frontend folder and install dependencies:
cd scheduler-frontend
npm install
Backend
Navigate to the scheduler-backend folder and install dependencies:
cd ../scheduler-backend
npm install


### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the scheduler-backend directory to set up backend environment variables (e.g., database connection, port).
# Example .env file for scheduler-backend
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url


### 4. Run the Application
### Backend
In the scheduler-backend directory, start the server:
npm start
The backend server should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

### Frontend
In the scheduler-frontend directory, start the Angular application:
ng serve
The frontend application should now be running on http://localhost:4200.

### Usage
Access the frontend at http://localhost:4200.
Use the UI to interact with the scheduler, such as creating and managing events.
The frontend communicates with the backend API running on http://localhost:3000/api.
